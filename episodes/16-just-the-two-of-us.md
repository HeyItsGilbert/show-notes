# Just The Two of Us

[Episode Link](https://powershellpodcast.podbean.com/e/just-the-two-of-us/)

After 5,000 downloads, Andrew and Jordan stop to say thank you for all of the support from the community. We also cover some of the very nice messages we have received and have a special community highlight for Drew McClellan. Then we cover some file system management information and discover that one of us is a little too attached to default settings. Finally, Jordan gets downright giddy to learn something new about PowerShell providers.
