[Episode Link](https://powershellpodcast.podbean.com/e/james-friggen-petty-microsoft-mvp/)


James Petty is crazy busy with all things PowerShell. He is running the upcoming PowerShell + DevOps Global Summit. James runs PowerShell.org, Co-Authoring PowerShell in a Month of Lunches, and in mid-May will be running The PowerShell "Firehose Class" with Don Jones where they do a DEEP dive into PowerShell. Finally, we talk about the value of the importexcel module and using PowerShell to wow the boss.

Guest Bio and links:

James Petty is the CEO of the DevOps Collective, a nonprofit for technology education. As well as the owner/moderator of PowerShell.org and its forums. Not satisfied with how bad he has already made me feel about my productivity, he is the lead writer for the 4th edition of PowerShell in a Month of Lunches while still maintaining his job as the solutions architect for Wyre Technologies.
