Episode Summary:

In this episode, we got to become familiar with a couple of Justin's favorite things: deep dives into subjects and axioms. Justin has a lot of experience and insight into the "why" behind things, and he doesn't hold back from sharing his wisdom with others. We covered human topics, like how Justin has dealt with imposter syndrome and developed his social skills over the years. We also covered technical topics like VS Code, the latest PowerShell extension release, PowerShell's sacred promise, and more. For each subject, he has a surprising depth of knowledge. This is an episode worth taking notes on.
