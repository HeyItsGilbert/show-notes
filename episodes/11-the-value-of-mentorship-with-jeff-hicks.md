[Episode Link](https://powershellpodcast.podbean.com/e/the-value-of-mentorship-with-jeff-hicks/)

Episode Summary:

We caught up with Jeff Hicks at the PowerShell and Global DevOps summit. He talks about how he always wanted to be a teacher and how PowerShell has helped him achieve that. We also discuss the holy trinity of PowerShell Cmdlet: Get-Help, Get-Command, and Get-Member, which will help you find the command you need, learn how to use it, and give you everything you would want to know about the objects it returns. Those commands can help you move through almost any roadblock while learning PowerShell. We end with a general discussion about PowerShell, and what we love most about it.
