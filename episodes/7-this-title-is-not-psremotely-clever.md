# This title is not psremotely clever

This episode highlights Matthew Dowst and his excellent PowerShell Weekly blogs on Dowst.dev. Then we talk about running PowerShell on remote machines and using Invoke-Command vs. Enter-PsSession. We spend a small amount of time on Just Enough Administration, allowing you to move some of your tasks to be handled by others. I finally make an error so bad that when I say, "Kelly can Edit that out," he is not able to! Not seen in the podcast was Kelly yelling at me in my office.
