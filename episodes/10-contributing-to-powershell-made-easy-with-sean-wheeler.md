# Contributing to PowerShell Made Easy with Sean Wheeler

[Episode Link](https://powershellpodcast.podbean.com/e/contributing-to-powershell-made-easy-with-sean-wheeler/)

We caught up with Sean Wheeler at the PowerShell + DevOps Global Summit to discuss all things documentation. We discuss why open source is an open discussion and how documentation moving to open source makes for a lot of opportunities to help contribute to the PowerShell community. We discuss the value of the PowerShell blog, and how contributing to the blog can help you practice and improve your writing skills, get your blogs published, and provides an opportunity to plug your own site at the same time.
