# Stop Typing So Much

https://powershellpodcast.podbean.com/e/stop-typing-so-much/


We are all about psreadline! The latest psreadline just hit General Availability as of February 23rd. We highlight John Savill and his awesome YouTube channel. We cover how to get psreadline up and running in VsCode. Lastly, we talk about some of our favorite features. Jordan likes the command prediction that uses your command history. Andrew loved CTRL + R which allows him to do a quick search to find an old command so he can reuse them.
