# The Power of Shell Compels You

In the first-ever episode, we break down who the hosts are and why we started this podcast. Getting that crap out of the way, we get to talk about PowerShell! We cover Kevin Marquette's "Everything you want to know about" series, focusing on psobjects that we both have used to help our writing. We take a look at the module PsWordle and discover Jordan accidentally learned something. Josh King announced he has done a preview release of Burnt Toast and is looking for people to help him test, as well as join in the discussion on what could be next. Finally, we talk about why $null should be on the left side for comparisons in your scripts.
